	 Recommended is 200 character limit for alt text. The alt text here goes beyond the limit but this probably ok, otherwise you would need to get into extended image descriptions with aria-describedby which might not be ideal for this type of simple childrenâ€™s book. NOTE THE LOGOS ON THE BACK COVER FOR DESCRIPTION INTO THE ALT TEXT
